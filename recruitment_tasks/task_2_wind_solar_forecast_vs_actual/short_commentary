#Short commentary:
#The dashboard compares day-ahead forecasts with actual wind and solar generation for the selected date, with all timestamps converted to CEST. 
#For both technologies, the graphs show where the forecast aligns with real output and where noticeable deviations occur. 
#Tables under each plot summarize the forecast error for every settlement period. 
#Larger mismatches — especially during high-generation hours — could have affected system balancing by increasing the need for reserve activation or short-term market adjustments.
